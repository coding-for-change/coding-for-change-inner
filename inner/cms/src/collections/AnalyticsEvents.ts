/**
 * First-party behavioural analytics.
 *
 * The inner site beacons events here (page views, form starts, conversions)
 * tagged with the visit's random `sessionId` and its campaign attribution, so we
 * can measure the funnel from traffic source → interaction → conversion.
 *
 * No IP, no fingerprint, no cookies, **no device storage of any kind.** The only
 * identifier is `sessionId`, which lives in the page's JavaScript memory and is
 * gone on refresh, in a new tab, and when the tab closes. Scope is therefore one
 * tab — enough to link "arrived from poster-tumsom" to "signed up", which is the
 * question this collection exists to answer.
 *
 * **Not consent-gated, deliberately.** It was, briefly, alongside a persistent
 * `visitorId`. Because that identifier was device storage under TDDDG § 25 the
 * whole subsystem sat behind the consent banner — and collection fell to zero,
 * since the banner isn't a cookie wall and almost nobody answers it. § 25 is
 * triggered by storing on or reading from the device, not by measurement as such,
 * so with the storage gone the ordinary Art. 6(1)(f) basis applies. DNT/GPC are
 * honoured as the Art. 21 objection route. Google Ads and GA4 remain fully gated
 * — they set real cookies.
 *
 * Public create (the site posts anonymously); admin-only read — mirrors the
 * WaitlistSignups access model.
