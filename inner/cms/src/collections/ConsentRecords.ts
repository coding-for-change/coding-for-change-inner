/**
 * Proof of consent — GDPR Art. 7(1) accountability.
 *
 * We run a self-hosted CMP (Klaro), so no vendor keeps our consent log for us.
 * Each row is one *interactive* decision: the visitor clicked something in the
 * banner. Silent re-application of a stored choice on later page loads is not
 * recorded, otherwise every pageview would append a duplicate and the log would
 * be worthless as evidence.
 *
 * Also relevant to Google's periodic EU User Consent Policy audit
 * (support.google.com/google-ads/answer/16724512): failing it can suspend
 * conversion measurement, which would break the Ad Grants ≥1-conversion/month
 * requirement.
 *
 * Deliberately minimal — **no IP, no user agent, no fingerprint**, consistent
 * with the rest of our analytics. The random `consentId` is mirrored in the
 * visitor's `cfc_consent_id` cookie, which is what makes a record linkable to
 * the browser that gave it; a record that ties to nothing proves nothing.
 *
 * `configVersion` records which banner configuration (and therefore which
 * wording) the decision was made against — see `CONSENT_CONFIG_VERSION` in the
 * inner site's `lib/klaroConfig.ts`.
 *
 * Note this collection is **not** covered by the analytics retention purge:
 * consent records must outlive the processing they authorise, since their whole
 * purpose is proving that processing was lawful at the time.
