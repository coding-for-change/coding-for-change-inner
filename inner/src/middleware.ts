/**
 * Honour `?lang=de` / `?lang=en` so a URL can pin the render language.
 *
 * Why this exists: locale was resolved purely from the `cfc-locale` cookie,
 * defaulting to English, with the client swapping to German after hydration if
 * `navigator.language` looked German. That left no way for an inbound link to
 * ask for a language — which broke the German Google Ads:
 *
 *   - a German ad could only point at a page that server-rendered English,
 *     and an ad-to-landing-page language mismatch drives Quality Score down.
 *     Ad Grants requires every active keyword to stay at QS >= 3, so this was a
 *     compliance problem, not only a cosmetic one.
 *   - German speakers on English-configured devices (common at TUM) got English
 *     regardless of the ad they clicked.
 *   - every German visitor saw a flash of English before hydration.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 *   - We **rewrite**, not redirect. A redirect would add a hop on every ad click
 *     and risk mangling the tracking parameters.
 *   - The cookie is set on the response *and* on the forwarded request, so the
 *     very same render already sees it — `cookies()` in a server component reads
 *     request cookies, so setting only the response cookie would leave the first
 *     paint in the wrong language and defeat the point.
 *   - `lang` is deliberately **not** stripped from the URL. `attribution.ts`
 *     already rewrites the address bar client-side to drop tracking params, and
 *     touching the query string here would mean re-implementing that carefully
 *     enough not to lose `gclid` — which Google Ads needs for conversion
 *     attribution. Not worth the risk for a cosmetic gain.
